    About Me - Alexander Nadeau
  </h1>
  <p> <!-- Paragraph 1: General Introduction and background -->
    Alexander Nadeau has always been fascinated with computers. Alex is a Computer Science Student studying at NVCC. Currently, this is his second round through Client-Side Web Development, so thankfully he has a bit of knowledge saved. Alex has been studying computers and their mechanisms
    for multiple years, starting as early as middle school. Before that, Alex was invested in computer games thanks to his sister, who had introduced him to his first game: UB Funkeys. From there, the repertoire of games expanded, across multiple consoles and systems.
    Once Alex was introduced to his first MMO, Wizard101, the fascination of computers and mechanics skyrocketed.
  </p>
  <p> <!-- Paragraph 2: Additional Information -->
    As time progressed, more and more games entered into the sphere of interest. Eventually, the games stopped being fun with the gameplay, but more informational about how certain mechanics operated within the system. This, compounded with the first computer classes in both Elementary 
    and Middle school, gave birth to the idea of being a computer programmer. That fascination grew and grew, becoming borderline addictive by definition. In High school, Alex branched out his knowledge into two subjects: Computer Science and Programming for Game design. Both classes scratched 
    that itch of programming, but it also caused a rift to form; more specifically, what subject does he want to pursue? With much deliberation and a lot of second guessing, Computer Science pushed through the fog and became the target of study.

      Top 5 Personal Tips for Final Fantasy XIV Department of Land and Hand classes
    </h2>
    <h4>Department of Hand classes are called Crafting Classes | Department of Land classes are called Gathering classes</h4>
    <ol>
      <li> <!-- Section 1: Managing successful crafting/gathering attempts -->
        Crafters and Gatherers can fail their respective goals. Each craft has a requirement to reach to achieve success, whereas gathering is a risk/reward system. Each have their own ways to combat this.<br><br>

        Crafters: You lot have numerous tools and resources to assist you in crafting. Macro makers like <a href="https://www.raphael-xiv.com" target="_blank">Raphael's Macro Maker</a> and <a href="https://ffxivteamcraft.com/simulator" target="_blank">Teamcraft's Crafting Simulator</a> are your ally in determining if you can successfully craft something.<br>
        You also have a tiny button in your crafting menu that will simulate the craft at your current gear and stats, allowing you to experiment with a rotation that works for you.<br><br>
        
        For Gathering, to ensure 100% chances of gathering you can utilize Gathering boosting actions that you unlock very early on. Miners get Sharp Vision (I/II/III) whereas Botanists get Field Mastery (I/II/III). These skills increase your chance of gathering by 5/15/50% respectfully.<br>
      </li>

      <li> <!-- Section 2: Utilizing food and medicine buffs-->
        Food and Medicine buffs are a vital part for crafters and a minor assistance towards gatherers. These buffs are crafted through <i><strong>CUL</strong></i>narian and <i><strong>ALC</strong></i>hemist classes and can provide a lot of help, assuming you have the time and patience to gather the materials.<br><br>

        For Crafters: Most end-game crafts are difficult to achieve 100% HQ without the need of a food buff or medicine buff. For these crafts, prioritizing the weakened stat, usually Control and Crafting Points (Will not abbreviate for reasons). Medicine buffs are typically reserved for Crafting Point boosting, but aren't usually needed.<br><br>
        
        For Gatherers: Most of the end-game gathering nodes, surprisingly, don't need food buffs to reach given the newest gearset that released. If you are struggling due to lacking Perception, then utilizing food buffs to reach the threshold to see a resource is advised.<br>
        The only medicine you should be using for Gatherers is Spiritbond potions to start getting Materia quicker to Penta-meld (or melding if your gear does not accept advanced melding) your gear and reduce the amount of food you will need.<br>

      <li> <!-- Section 3: Leveling tips for crafting/gathering professions -->
          Leveling Tips for Crafting and Gathering<br><br>
  
          <strong>Important before starting this section!</strong> All gathering and crafting classes have a buff called "(Crafter/Gatherer)'s Grace" which is given by using a Revised Manual purchased from the Scrip traders for 30 Purple scrips each.<br>
          These are 150% buff to EXP gain up until <strong>2 Million</strong> EXP for a Department of Hand/Land class for 18 Hours, but fall off to 50% effectiveness, which means 75% EXP boost, at level 80 and beyond.<br>
          There are other versions for earlier levels, but these are the current best to use.<br><br>
          
          Crafter leveling is the easiest, yet most tedious. To begin, work on leveling via class quests to 20. Upon completing Patch 3.3: <i><a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Post-Heavensward_Main_Scenario_Quests" target="_blank">Litany of Peace</a></i>, you will unlock Ishgardian Restoration. <br> 
          Stay there until level 60 or 70, depending on the tolerance. <strong>IF</strong> you have completed the Patch 6.0: Endwalker, you can begin <i>Cosmic Exploration</i> which is a fantastic way of leveling classes. <br><br>
  
          
          Gatherer leveling follows the same routine, with one major exception. Most of the steps can be followed similarly, but upon reaching Level 80, the focus shifts over to gathering <i>Collectables</i>. From levels 81-100, gathering collectables are by far the most important.<br>
          Gathering materials for high-end crafting requires a lot of Folklore books and materia, which can be purchased from Scrip vendors across Eorzea. Collectables provide scrips for the respective classes and a burst of EXP for the class the collectable was collected on.<br>
          <strong>Note:</strong> Fishing collectables are more challenging to achieve, often requiring specific conditions to catch. There are various resources and community groups that are out there, such as <a href="https://ffxivteamcraft.com" target="_blank">Teamcraft</a> that will assist you.<br>
          
      </li>

      <li> <!-- Section 4: Class Quests -->
          Similarly to how your fighting classes level, Crafting and Gathering quests are invaluable to your successes in your respective classes.<br>
          Crafters get "Manipulation" which is priceless for crafting, whereas Gatherers get multiple skills that will help them in the field. <br><br>

          For Crafters: Manipulation is unlocked at the level 63 class quest. Quests from level 60 onwards give you the materials to craft with. The only grind is doing the class quests from level 1-50, as they require you to manually gather the items.<br>
          After level 50, the materials needed can be purchased from vendors in Idyllshire for a hefty gil cost. One of the ending quests will request you get a specific Master Crafting book to craft, so be prepared for it.<br><br>

          For Gatherers: Gatherer's will be running around constantly for their quests. The difference here is that some of the gathering quests need a resource that comes from a <i>Timed Node</i>. These nodes happen every so often on Eorzea Time in set spots.<br>
          You can purchase the material from the Marketboard or pre-maturely gather the item by looking at the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Miner_Quests" target="_blank">Miner Quest Tree</a>, the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Botanist_Quests" target="_blank">Botanist Quest Tree</a>, or the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Fisher_Quests" target="_blank">Fisher Quest Tree</a>.<br>
      </li>

      <li> <!-- Section 5: Crafting/Gathering Gear -->
          Crafting and Gathering gear is a bit of a rough subject, since there's quite a few to sift through. Most importantly in regards to Crafting/Gathering Gear: Your Best in Slot (Abbr. BiS) gear will take numerous <strong>HOURS</strong> to achieve. Focus on more cheap sets until you can afford it all. <br><br>

          For Crafters: You can, realistically, get away with getting the Scrip sets every 10 levels, starting at level 70. There are earlier scrip sets, but these are class specific, whereas the level 70+ Scrip sets are universal for the Department of Land/Hand respectively.<br>
          For Gatherers: Similar to the crafters, you can get away with the Scrip sets. That changes in high end gathering as the Perception requirements change dramatically, forcing you into using the crafted sets. If you are struggling with gearing up, the marketboard is your <strong>Enemy</strong>. Focus on collecting the materials you can and buying the raw materials you can't gather and work with that.<br>
