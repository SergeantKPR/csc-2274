    About Me - Alexander Nadeau
  </h1>
  <p> <!-- Paragraph 1: General Introduction and background -->
    Alexander Nadeau has always been fascinated with computers. Alex is a Computer Science Student studying at NVCC. Currently, this is his second round through Client-Side Web Development, so thankfully he has a bit of knowledge saved. Alex has been studying computers and their mechanisms
    for multiple years, starting as early as middle school. Before that, Alex was invested in computer games thanks to his sister, who had introduced him to his first game: UB Funkeys. From there, the repertoire of games expanded, across multiple consoles and systems.
    Once Alex was introduced to his first MMO, Wizard101, the fascination of computers and mechanics skyrocketed.
  </p>
  <p> <!-- Paragraph 2: Additional Information -->
    As time progressed, more and more games entered into the sphere of interest. Eventually, the games stopped being fun with the gameplay, but more informational about how certain mechanics operated within the system. This, compounded with the first computer classes in both Elementary 
    and Middle school, gave birth to the idea of being a computer programmer. That fascination grew and grew, becoming borderline addictive by definition. In High school, Alex branched out his knowledge into two subjects: Computer Science and Programming for Game design. Both classes scratched 
    that itch of programming, but it also caused a rift to form; more specifically, what subject does he want to pursue? With much deliberation and a lot of second guessing, Computer Science pushed through the fog and became the target of study.

      Top 5 Personal Tips for Final Fantasy XIV Department of Land and Hand classes
    </h2>
    <h4>Department of Hand classes are called Crafting Classes | Department of Land classes are called Gathering classes</h4>
    <ol>
      <li> <!-- Section 1: Managing successful crafting/gathering attempts -->
        For Crafting, utilize trial synthesis if you are unsure if your gear is up to scratch<br>
        For Gathering, utilize Field Mastery (for BTN) / Sharp Vision (for MIN) if you cannot reach 100% gatherability (Top Percentage)
      </li>

      <li> <!-- Section 2: Utilizing food and medicine buffs-->
        For Crafting, Food / Medicine buffs are <strong>IMPORTANT</strong> in future + endgame crafts and content. Leveling <i><strong>CUL</strong></i>narian and <i><strong>ALC</strong></i>hemist are important to make.<br>
        For Gathering, Food buffs are not nearly as important, but can give a boon toward a node that you aren't quite geared for. Utilizing food given from quests is advized if stats aren't up to par.

          Crafter leveling is the easiest, yet most tedious. To begin, work on leveling via class quests to 20. Upon completing Patch 3.3: <i><a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Post-Heavensward_Main_Scenario_Quests">Litany of Peace</a></i>, you will unlock Ishgardian Restoration. 
          Stay there until level 60 or 70, depending on the tolerance. <strong>IF</strong> you have completed the Patch 6.0: Endwalker, you can begin <i>Cosmic Exploration</i> which is a fantastic way of leveling classes.

        <pre>
          Gatherer leveling follows the same routine, with one major exception. Most of the steps can be followed similarly, but upon reaching Level 80, the focus shifts over to gathering <i>Collectables</i>. From levels 81-100, gathering collectables are by far the most important.
          Gathering materials for high-end crafting requires a lot of Folklore books and materia, which can be purchased from Scrip vendors across Eorzea. Collectables provide scrips for the respective classes and a burst of EXP for the class the collectable was collected on.
          <strong>Note:</strong> Fishing collectables are more challenging to achieve, often requiring specific conditions to catch. There are various resources and community groups that are out there, such as <a href="https://ffxivteamcraft.com">Teamcraft</a> that will assist you.
